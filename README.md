## Hey! 👋
Hello! I'm Pablo Rossetti, a passionate Full Stack Developer always seeking new opportunities to grow in my professional career.

Recently, I led the development of a Pizzas application where I consolidated my skills in teamwork, leadership, and agile methodologies. It was a great challenge, but I am proud of the final result and how I improved both as a developer and as a person.

Regarding my technical skills, I have experience in HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Chakra, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. I am always learning to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends.

Aside from my work as a developer, I enjoy sharing knowledge with other developers and learning from them. I also like to stay active and healthy by practicing sports or going for walks.

Thanks for visiting my Github profile, I'm excited to be part of this community and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you on exciting projects. If you have any questions or want to know more about my experience, please don't hesitate to contact me.
